# Web Development Internship â€“ Hum Network Ltd

This repository contains selected code samples and projects developed during my internship as a **Web Development Intern** in the **Business Intelligence Department** at **Hum Network Ltd**.

## Overview

During the internship, I had the opportunity to work across the full web development stack. My responsibilities included managing databases, writing backend logic, and developing dynamic and responsive frontend interfaces. I also integrated APIs and worked with JSON to enable smooth data communication between different layers of the application. These tasks provided me with practical experience in building real-world applications and a deeper understanding of how front-end and back-end systems interact in production environments.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a collection of key components and concepts I worked on during my internship. While specific project details may be generalized or redacted for confidentiality, the code reflects practical implementations of full stack development tasks within a collaborative, production-oriented environment.

# Project Setup Instructions

## Importing Files

1. Import all the files listed above (from this repository) into the directory `C:\xampp\htdocs\hr`.

## Accessing Working Files

- For PHP files, you can access them via a web browser by entering the corresponding URL. For example, to access the main index file, use: http://localhost/hr/index.php

## Accessing Files in Subdirectories

- If the PHP files are located within subdirectories (e.g., `inc`, `assets`, `api`, etc.), ensure to include the folder path in the URL. For example, to access the `users.php` file located in the `api` folder, use: http://localhost/hr/api/users.php

## Relative Main Files

| users           | sidebar         | logout           |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| login           | location       | index           |
| header          | footer         | desks            |
| designation     | departments     | dashboard        |
| connect         | channels        | assets           |
| assetassignment | add_users       | add_designation  |
| add_departments | add_channel     | add_assets       |

By following these steps, you will be able to set up and access the project files successfully.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have XAMPP installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the necessary services:

1. **Install XAMPP**: 
   - Download and install XAMPP from the [official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

2. **Start XAMPP Control Panel**: 
   - Open the XAMPP Control Panel.

3. **Enable Services**: 
   - In the XAMPP Control Panel, ensure that both **Apache** and **MySQL** services are started. You can do this by clicking the "Start" button next to each service.

By ensuring that XAMPP is installed and both Apache and MySQL are running, you will be able to access your project files without any issues.
