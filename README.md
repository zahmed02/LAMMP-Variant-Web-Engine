# Web Development Internship ‚Äì Hum Network Ltd

This repository contains selected code samples and projects developed during my internship as a **Web Development Intern** in the **Business Intelligence Department** at **Hum Network Ltd**.

## Overview

During the internship, I had the opportunity to work across the full web development stack. My responsibilities included managing databases, writing backend logic, and developing dynamic and responsive frontend interfaces. I also integrated APIs and worked with JSON to enable smooth data communication between different layers of the application. These tasks provided me with practical experience in building real-world applications and a deeper understanding of how front-end and back-end systems interact in production environments.
